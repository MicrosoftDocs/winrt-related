# Device Family Extension SDKs and API contracts

The way of thinking about app-targeting changes with Windows 10. The new conceptual model is that UWP apps target the Universal Windows Platform by default, which provides a common API surface across devices. But you can also target the capabilities of specific devices by using an extension SDK. For more info on what a extension SDK is, and how to decide which one to target, see [Device families overview](device-families-overview.md).

This reference topic enumerates all of the extension SDKs with links to topics that list the contracts available in each extension.
