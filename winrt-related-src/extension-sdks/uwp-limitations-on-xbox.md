# UWP features not supported on Xbox

Xbox runs Windows 10, which means that it has the same core operating system as other devices in the Windows 10 family&mdash;for example, desktop, IoT, and HoloLens. But there are some feature areas that aren't at the same level of support on Xbox as they have on other devices.

This topic lists some of the feature areas that your UWP app might use that don't function as fully on Xbox. All APIs are callable, and will fail gracefully if they're unsupported.
