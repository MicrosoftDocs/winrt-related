# Win32 and COM APIs for UWP apps
A Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app (or a [Windows Runtime component](/windows/uwp/winrt-components/)) written in C++/CX has access to the Win32 and COM APIs that are part of the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).

Most of these APIs are implemented by all Windows 10 devices, and that set is listed first (in two forms: grouped by module, and listed in alphabetical order of name). Then, additional APIs that are part of the UWP but that are not present on all Windows 10 devices, are listed.

For convenience, an umbrella library named WindowsApp.lib is provided in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), which provides the exports for this set of Win32 APIs. Link your app with WindowsApp.lib (and no other libraries) to access these APIs.</p></td>
