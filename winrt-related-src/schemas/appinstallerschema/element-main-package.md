# MainPackage (App installer schema)

The MainPackage element specifies the information about the package which includes name, publisher, version and uri. ProcessorArchitecture and ResourceId are optional attributes of the MainPackage. 

## Element hierarchy

<dl>
<dt><a href="element-appinstaller.md">&lt;AppInstaller&gt;</a></dt>

## Syntax
``` xml
<MainPackage 
    Name        = A string between 3 and 50 characters in length that consists of alpha-numeric, period, and dash characters.
    Publisher   = A string between 1 and 8192 characters in length that fits the regular expression of a distinguished name: "(CN|L|O|OU|E|C|S|STREET|T|G|I|SN|DC|SERIALNUMBER|(OID\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*))+))=(([^,+="<>#;])+|".*")(, ((CN|L|O|OU|E|C|S|STREET|T|G|I|SN|DC|SERIALNUMBER|(OID\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*))+))=(([^,+="<>#;])+|".*")))*". Further, semantic validation ensures that the string is compliant with CertNameToStr Windows API implementation of X.500 rules.
    Version     = A version string in quad notation, "Major.Minor.Build.Revision".
    ProcessorArchitecture  = "x86" | "x64" | "arm" | "neutral"
    Uri         = Uri to the app package location 
    ResourceId? = An ASCII string between 1 and 30 characters in length. />
```
