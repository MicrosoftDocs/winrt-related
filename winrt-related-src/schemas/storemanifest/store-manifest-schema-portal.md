# StoreManifest schema


## Purpose


StoreManifest.xml is an optional configuration file that may be included in packages submitted to the Windows Store. Its purpose is to enable features, such as declaring your app as a Windows Store device app, that the AppxManifest.xml file does not cover. StoreManifest.xml is submitted with the app package and must be in the root folder of your app's main project.
