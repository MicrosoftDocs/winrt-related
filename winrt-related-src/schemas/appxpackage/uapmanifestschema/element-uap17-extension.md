## Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Data type | Required |

| desktop11:AppLifecycleBehavior | Allows an app to override the lifecycle behavior associated with the runtime behavior for the extension. Apps or extensions with a **RuntimeBehavior** of "windowsApp" implicitly have **AppLifecycleBehavior** of "systemManaged". Apps or extensions with **RuntimeBehavior** of "packagedClassicApp" or "win32App" implicitly have **AppLifecycleBehavior** of "unmanaged" | One of the following values: "systemManaged" , "unmanaged".| No |
| Executable | The default launch executable. | One of the following values: A string between 1 and 256 characters in length that must end with ".exe" and cannot contain these characters: <, >, :, ", ,, ?, or *.| No |
