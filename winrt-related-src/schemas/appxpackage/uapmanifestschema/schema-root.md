# Package manifest schema reference for Windows 10

This reference provides details for each element, attribute, and data type that defines the schema for the app package manifest for Windows 10 apps. The schema definition files are UapManifestSchema.xsd, FoundationManifestSchema.xsd, AppxManifestTypes.xsd, and others.
