## Remarks

The com4 extension is essentially a rewrite of the old windows.comServer/windows.comInterface extension syntax. This extension is a superset of the previous com extension functionality, with identical behavior for the inherited syntax. Manifest validation for the new syntax as used in packaging is better aligned with the semantic requirements of the extension.

- In the previous version, each extension was treated as a separate document, allowing non-unique keys and dangling references to be validated.
- In the previous version, duplication of attributes subject to unique/key constraints was only caught by manifest validation if the duplicated attributes appear in the same instance of the extension. Packages that duplicated these attributes would fail to deploy, with limited diagnostic information to identify the problem.
- In the previous version, a keyref whose referent is in a different instance of the extension would be blocked by manifest validation, which is an artificial restriction relative to what the deployment/runtime behavior support.

Applications targeting Windows 11 that can use the new com4 namespace for all of their windows.comServer/windows.comInterface extensions should use it. Mixing the new namespace with the older namespaces is not recommended, for reasons including:

- Deploying the package on versions that support the new namespace will handle extensions from all namespaces, and any unique identifiers duplicated between extensions using different namespace versions will result in a failure. Use of the older namespaces prevents manifest validation from detecting these errors.
- Due to limitations of the older namespace schemas, a keyref in the old syntax cannot refer to a key in the new syntax because these are in different instances of the extension.

Use of the following com4 syntax semantics have capability requirements:

- CompatMode="classic" requires Microsoft.classicAppCompat_8wekyb3d8bbwe
- Scope="machine" requires Microsoft.classicAppCompatElevated_8wekyb3d8bbwe

The following example shows how to register an out-of-process and an in-process server implementation for the same class.

## Examples

```xml
<com4:Class Id="f4ed7720-9b3a-44a4-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" DisplayName="CLSID_Foo"/> 
<com:ExeServer Executable="MyServer.exe" DisplayName="My server">  
  <com4:ClassReference Id="f4ed7720-9b3a-44a4-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"/>  
</com:ExeServer> 
<com4:InProcessServer Path="MyServer.dll">  
  <com4:ClassReference Id="f4ed7720-9b3a-44a4-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"/>  
</com4:InProcessServer> 

```

### New features in the com4 extension

- Support for in-process servers (both unmanaged and managed) and custom in-process handlers (that is, not the OLE default handler). This capability is currently functionally limited and restricted by policy:
  - This is currently intended for use only by packages with external location; it doesn't work for most normal packages due to ACLs on the install location that prevent the package's dlls from being loaded outside the package. For more information on packages with external location, see [Grant package identity by packaging with external location](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/grant-identity-to-nonpackaged-apps).
- It is now possible to associate a TypeLib with a class registration.
