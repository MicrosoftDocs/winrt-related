# Windows UI Library 2.1

WinUI 2.1 is the second major release of the Windows UI Library. 

WinUI is the easiest way to build great Fluent Design experiences for Windows.

It includes two NuGet packages:

* [Microsoft.UI.Xaml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml): Controls and Fluent Design for UWP apps. This is the main WinUI package.

* [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct): Low-level APIs for use in middleware components.

You can download and use WinUI packages in your app using the NuGet package manager: see [Getting Started with the Windows UI Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/toolkits/winui/getting-started) for more information.

WinUI is an open source project hosted on GitHub. We welcome bug reports, feature requests and community code contributions in the [Windows UI Library repo](https://aka.ms/winui).
