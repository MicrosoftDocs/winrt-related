# Extension SDKs

The way of thinking about app-targeting changes with Windows 10. The new conceptual model is that UWP apps target an extension SDK. For more info on what a extension SDK is, and how to decide which one to target, see [Guide to Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps[(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide)].
This reference topic enumerates all of the extension SDKs and their versions, with links to topics with more info on each extension SDK.
